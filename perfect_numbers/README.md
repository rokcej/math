# Perfect Numbers

## Introduction

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding itself.

**Fun fact**: It is not yet known whether any odd perfect numbers exist, nor if there are infinitely many perfect numbers ([source][perfect-number]).

## Results

The following table shows all perfect numbers below 1,000,000.
* **PN n** - Perfect number $n$
* **d(n)** - Divisor function $\text{d}(n)$ (number of divisors of $n$)

|    |   PN n |   d(n) | Divisors of n                                                   |
|---:|-------:|-------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 |      6 |      4 | [1, 2, 3, 6]                                                    |
|  2 |     28 |      6 | [1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28]                                            |
|  3 |    496 |     10 | [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248, 496]                         |
|  4 |  8,128 |     14 | [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 254, 508, 1016, 2032, 4064, 8128] |
